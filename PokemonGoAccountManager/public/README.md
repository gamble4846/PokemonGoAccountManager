# Public folder

Place **Accounts.csv** here.

- The home page always loads from `/Accounts.csv`.
- Use the **Upload CSV** page to upload your CSV and download **Accounts.csv**, then put it in this folder (or on your server when you deploy).

CSV must have columns: Email, UserName, Password, Category (or Catagory).
